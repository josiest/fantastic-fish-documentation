# Fantastic Fish: First Playable Prototype

The main idea is a clone of the fishing in stardew valley, but there needs to
be more to have a better game loop. There should also be a difficulty curve -
so that the most difficult fish aren't immediately there.

## Core gameplay loop

- Explore ruins with 3d platforming
- Fish at fishing spots
- Run sushi restaurant with caught fish
- sushi restaurant similar to overcooked or coffee caravan
